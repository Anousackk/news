                <h2>The Challenges in Lao Agriculture</h2>
                <img src="https://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/photos/laos-agriculture-1846.jpg">
                <p>In Laos, agricultural challenges comprise of changes in land use and climate, and low quality
                    agricultural products and commodities. Cash crops such as rice, coffee, tobacco and sugarcanes keep
                    changing to industrial crops such as rubber and agarwood. This leads to land use conflicts. <br><br>
                    Agriculture in Laos experiences slow growth rate and economics are concerned that Laos will suffer a
                    shortfall in agriculture production due to long dry season, diseases, and flooding. Farmers also
                    encounters difficulties in accessing finance, lack of techonical knowledge and equipments needed to
                    produce good quality products that will meet the market needs. Many families even struggle to meet
                    their food requirements at home, this makes malnutrition a big issue as well.<br><br>Investment in
                    agriculture sector in Laos is also lacking. Traditional production methods can't produce enough to
                    meet the demands. Other threats include poor crop storage and handling practices, and climate change
                    and natural disasters such as flooding and drought have put off investors.</p>
                <div class="section2">
                    <h2>What can be the solutions to these challenges?</h2>
                    <h3>Possible solutions that the Government could take actions: </h3>
                    <p> - &nbsp; Government should have a clear agriculture promotion policy to help farmers tackle the
                        challenges and boost productivity and also regulate the use of pesticides and other chemicals to
                        avoid environmental impacts. <br> - &nbsp; Provide educational training on techinical knowledge
                        and the use of equipment needed for production to farmers.</p>

                    <p>- &nbsp; Seek for more domestic and foreign investors to invest more in this sector. <br> -
                        &nbsp; Instruct local authorities to diversify and encourage farmers to grow other crops to make
                        higher income and be able to feed enough food for their families. </p>

                    <h3>Ways to engage youths in agricuture: </h3>
                    <p> - &nbsp; Provide platform for young people to discuss, share ideas and experiences in
                        agricultural development. <br> - &nbsp; School curricular could have farming modules and guide
                        students on how to grow and market their crops. <br> - &nbsp; Attract young people on social
                        media by promoting agriculture in a creative and educative way. </p>
